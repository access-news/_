To continue from your email, you can start assigning Folsom Telegraph issues (and I should add it to the system), but here are all the publications that are already in our publication guide (and more; see below) which could also be assigned. Unfortunately, many don\'t have readily downloadable digital editions (i.e., the articles will have to be saved one by one, until we can automate it). I tried to assign saving articles to volunteers in the past, but it got messy real fast, and only 2 of them actually did something for about 2 weeks\... The problems:

1.  **It is boring**

    This is especially understandable because the whole process can be automated (with enough time\...).

1.  **Feeling betrayed**

    Our website specifically says reading articles, and most new volunteers already feel offended that they have to read the ads, and asking them to do such a menial task probably feels like a slap in the face. We can fix the issue of \"false advertising\" on our web page, but there will always be folks who won\'t like the tasks given (which is fine:).

1.  **Being uncomfortable with more technical instructions**

    Simply printing an article page directly to file (e.g., in PDF format) also saves all the ads, sidebars, comments, decorative elements, etc., rendering the saved article nigh unreadable. To solve this, I had to resort to parsing the pages using JavaScript in the browser\'s Developer Tools. Folks don\'t have to be knowledgeable about either, and we can make it easier with tricks such as using [bookmarklets](https://gist.github.com/toraritte/e9d7a01dba1fd6a55c65b36274cd35cb), but they will probably have to get out of their comfort zone - and trust our guidance.)

1.  **No process to track which articles have been saved and recorded** in order to avoid duplicating work.

    For example, \______  is reading 7-10 articles a week from the Woodland Daily Democrat, but this is a daily paper, so this is about half or third of a daily issue. For papers that don\'t have e-editions, this is more crucial because both efforts (i.e., saving and recording) needs to be coordinated.

Please don\'t hesitate to share your ideas; I only have vague ones and none of them seem to be particularly effective. (The real solution is automation, and we\'ll eventually get there, but we might need something in the meantime.)

With that said, the lists:

-   [**Braille Monitor**](https://nfb.org/resources/publications-and-media/braille-monitor)

    Put this at the top because this one is available in audio, we just need to download them periodically. I\'m ashamed to admit that I haven\'t checked this in a while\...

-   **publications with e-editions**

-   -   [**Sacramento Bee**](https://www.sacbee.com/)

        Listing this first because this should be a \"priority\" for folks who would like to read articles. Almost every section is important, except for classifieds, ads, sports and weather stats - am I missing something? (Used the quotes because the real priority are the ads, but this is priority among the newspapers.) The reason I never pushed this is because we haven\'t had access to for almost half a year now. Tried calling support again, was able to reach someone, and now it works. If you have issues with accessing the editions, please let me know, and I\'ll them again.

    -   **Santa Rosa Press Democrat**

        They have an archive going back months, and any daily issue that hasn\'t been assigned can be downloaded and sent to readers.  (Also, Sunday editions are huge, and can be downloaded in 7 or 8 parts, about 50 MB each, so these don\'t even have to go to the same volunteer.)

    -   [**Humboldt Senior News**](https://humsenior-ca.newsmemory.com/)

        Hasn\'t been read in years. See all the archived issues under \"Editions\".

    -   [**MediaNews Group publications**](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/communities/)

        [They own newspapers all over the US](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/communities/), and because of a glitch in their login system, we can access all publications under \"West\" through a single valid subscription to the Woodland Daily Democrat. (After doing a spot check, \"Northeast\", \"Midwest\", and \"Southeast\" papers seem to use a different login provider so this won\'t work on those, but if any of them migrate to the login system \"West\" papers use, then those will be available too.) (By the way, the situation was the same with the Sacramento Bee\'s publisher, McClatchy, but they fixed this loophole.)

        So, you can choose any of the papers in the \"West\" section, but these are the ones also in our publication guide:

        -   [**Woodland Daily Democrat**](https://www.dailydemocrat.com/)

        -   **Eureka Times Standard**

        -   **East Bay Times**

        -   [**Fort Bragg Advocate-News**](https://www.advocate-news.com/)

        -   [**Mendocino Beacon**](https://www.mendocinobeacon.com/)

    -   [**Gold Country Media publications**](https://mynewsonthego.com/GoldCountry/SignIn.aspx)

        An even better situation as with the MediaNews Group: we have access to all of their papers through the only valid subscription of the Auburn Journal. These are the ones in current publication guide:

        -   **Auburn Journal**

        -   **Loomis News**

        -   **Roseville Press Tribune**

    -  [North Coast Journal](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/)

       A free magazine with [downloadable issues](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/).  \______ is reading the hard copies at the moment, but we are not mailing anything for now, and the last issue she has is February 2022.

-   online only publications (or ones that require manual download)

    -   **Comstock\'s Magazine**

        This is a free magazine and couldn\'t figure out how to even manually download it yet. [Here are the past editions](https://www.comstocksmag.com/digital-edition-0), and it hasn\'t been read since last June, so plenty of material there.

    -   [**Sacramento City Express**](https://sacramentocityexpress.com/)

        This is the official news board of the city of Sacramento. It is free, no login required.

    -   [The Observer](https://sacobserver.com/)

        Another free publication from Sacramento.

    -   **Newsweek**

        We talked about this the other day.

    -   [**News & Review publications**](https://www.newsreview.com/)
        (Sacramento, Chico, Reno)

        These haven\'t been read at least since 2019, and the archived issues of all three regional publications can be downloaded or read online.

    -   [Sacramento Magazine](https://www.sacmag.com/digital-edition/)

        I remember someone reading ca. 5 articles from one issue last year so these are also up for grabs, going back years.  (Couldn\'t figure out how to download the issues yet, so this is another online-only one.)

    -   [Cal Matters](https://calmatters.org/)

        This is one that does get read from time to time (at least I see the submissions), but this is where item 4. above gets important (i.e., to come up with a process to track saved and read papers\...).

    -   [Valley Community Newspapers](https://www.valcomnews.com/)

        Every tab is a publication; they don\'t update often, but none of them has been read for years.

    -   [Elk Grove Citizen](http://www.egcitizen.com/)

        No e-edition, individual articles to be downloaded and tracked.

    -   [SacTown](https://www.sactownmag.com/issue-archive/)

        No e-edition, individual articles to be downloaded and tracked.  (Also, \______  is reading hard copies of it, but I think we are going to stop dealing with hard copies for good.)

    -   [KQED](https://www.kqed.org/)

        No e-edition, individual articles to be downloaded and tracked.

    -   [Capital Public Radio](https://www.capradio.org/)

        No e-edition, individual articles to be downloaded and tracked.

Finally, here\'s the list of publication that are on the publication guide, but I can\'t access them so I will have to check the subscriptions:

-   Davis Enterprise

-   The Grass Valley - Nevada City Union

-   Stockton Record

-   Mad River Union

-   Entertainment Weekly

-   Fortune

I think I got all of them. Thanks again and please let me know if you have question or have ideas to share!
