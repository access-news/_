Hi Flipp Team,

Thank you for getting back to us!

If you ever decide to build an app in the open (as you seem to be

Stay safe and have a great rest of your day!

Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out to the Flipp Support team!

At this time, we do not offer the capability to use an API to integrate
to the Flipp app. I have relayed this request to our team as we do track
all incoming requests and we are always looking for ways to improve the
Flipp app for all users.

Please let me know if you have any other feedback or questions I will be
more than happy to get back to you!

Cheers!

Flipp Support\

flyer data

Dear Flipp Team,

My name is Attila Gulyas, manager of the Access News audio reading
service at Society For The Blind, a non-profit organization in
Sacramento, CA.

<https://societyfortheblind.org/programs-services/access-news/>

The most popular content among our blind, low vision, and print-impaired
subscribers are the store ads, and I\'m wondering if there is a public
API to your service or another way to access the textual information in
the flyers?

The reason I\'m asking is because the specials are read by volunteers
every week, which means that the audio version is only available to
listeners with a 2--4-day delay, depending on volunteer availability.
Having the data would allow us to use text-to-speech technology to
publish these almost immediately after publication.

Have a great rest of your day and wishing you a wonderful weekend!

Appreciatively,

Attila Gulyas \| Manager of Access News
