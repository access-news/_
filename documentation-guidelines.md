# Documentation guidelines

## Time spent on documentation is NOT a waste of time

That is, any kinds of activity related to it, not just the actual process of writing, but including the ones below.

Sometimes a figure complements the explanation, but takes a lot of time. Nonetheless, do not hesitate.

## Contribute to the documentation of related projects

Freeswitch, nix
you are helping your future self, but also paving the way for future collaborators who need to get up to speed by learning tools used in this project.

## If you ask yourself: "Should I document this?", the answer is almost always "yes"

Document findings:

+ implementation details eg. fs events -> how did I figure out what events to handle in TR2 state machine, and how did it affect the solution that I arrived at?

+ learning process, heureka moments, tips, best practices, etc. that may not fit the technology's documentation guidelines by their community, but that would help


## Continuously think about how to improve the documentation

The process itself, what other tools could be used, organization, etc.

Best way to document the source code

Previous section, last item: how to connect these back to the technology's documentation, commiunity etc.? (not just in a unidirectional way, referring to them in our docs, but a way that those docs are also referring to ours)
