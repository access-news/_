# Priorities

To sum it up front given our current circumstances:

1. System maintenance

2. Spend more time and energy on volunteers who are willing to read the ads.

3. TR2 and an content-reading automation

4. Other volunteer communications

Which means that some of the volunteer communications can be deferred to certain days only to maximize effort on development.

How I got to this conclusion:

## Main priorities

1. Subscribers

   Any activity or project that subscribers can benefit from.

2. Administration

   Mostly record keeping for the grant (i.e., volunteer times, subscriber numbers, etc.).

3. Volunteers

   Any other deed not covered above.

## Content priorities

To break it down in terms of content:

1. **Store sale flyers**

   Subscribers are relying on these, and they should be on time. Unfortunately, these are also the least favored by volunteers, therefore communications with anyone who **reads them acceptably well** and **on time** should be prioritized.

2. **Old-time radio shows** (and TODO: old TV shows with audio descriptions)

   These are static content scavanged from the web from the golden age of radio, and the favorite of the majority of our subscribers (most of whom are seniors). Our selection is probably the most extensive of all the other reading services currently active, but it is still missing a lot, and TR2's user interface is too primitive to make this a nice listening experience.

3. **SacBee sports listings by Carla**

4. **Magazines by Julie**:

   + Mental Floss
   + Atlas Obscura
   + Wild West
   + Civil War Times

   The same TR2 usability notes apply as above.

5. Anything else

   Ironically, Access News' least important content right now are the articles of daily newspapers, thus tending to volunteers who read only these should take up as little of our time as possible (however rude this may sound). The articles are still important because people do listen to them from time to time - and we are working on improving usability to promote this - but we have to cater to the current needs.

## Project priorities]

All this translates to the following project priorities:

0. Documentation

1. TR2

2. Content-reading automation (ads, and eventually articles)

3. Alternative delivery methods to subscribers

4. Access News website

(Item 1. and 2. should be on the same level, but TR2 won out, because its deployment is very flaky, the project is almost undocumented, and yet it is currently the only content-delivery system of the service.)

The above list doesn't mean that lower priority projects cannot be worked on in parallel! This may sound like a contradiction, but my point is that the amount of effort expended / allocated should reflect this order, and expertise will also determine who is going to work on what.

Research project-specific topics, and learning related technologies may also ignore this order as technologies, solutions can overlap in different projects.
