## Priorities

To sum up front:

1.

How I got to this conclusion:

On the highest level:

1. Subscribers

  Any activity and project that subscribers can benefit from. (Using bullet points for easier re-organization, but the order of the list matters: the higher the task, the more important it is.)

2. Administration

  Mostly record keeping for the grant (i.e., volunteer times, subscriber numbers, etc.).

3. Volunteers

  Any other deed not covered above.

To break it down in terms of content:

1. **Store sale flyers**

  Subscribers are relying on these to be on time. Unfortunately, these are also the least favorite reading material by volunteers, therefore anyone who **reads them acceptably well** and **on time** should be prioritized - and perhaps even indulged.

2. **Old-time radio shows** (and TODO: old TV shows with audio descriptions)

  These are static content scavanged from the web from the golden age of radio, and the favorite of the majority of our subscribers (most of whom are seniors). Our selection is probably the most extensive of all the other reading services currently active, but it is still missing a lot, and TR2's user interface is too primitive to make this a nice listening experience.

3. **Magazines by Julie**:
  + Mental Floss
  + Atlas Obscura
  + Wild West
  + Civil War Times

  The same TR2 usability notes apply as above.

4. Anything else

  Ironically, Access News' least important content right now are the articles of daily newspapers, thus tending to volunteers who read only these should take up as little of our time as possible (however rude this may sound). The articles are still important because people do listen to them time to time - and we are working on improving usability to promote this - but we have to cater to the current needs.

Which translates roughly to the following project priorities:

1. TR2

2. Automate the reading of ads (and articles)

3. Alternative delivery methods to subscribers

4. Access News website

(Item 1. and 2. should be on the same level, but TR2 won out, because its deployment is very flaky, the project is almost undocumented, and yet it is currently the only content-delivery system of the service.)

The above list doesn't mean that lower priority projects cannot be worked on in parallel! This may sound like a contradiction, but my point is that the amount of effort expended / allocated should reflect this order. Also, expertise will also determine who is going to work on what, but this can be fluid (e.g., when learning new technologies that would fit here and there).
